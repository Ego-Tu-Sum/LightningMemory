# TEMPORAL MATRIX VAULT - README FRAMEWORK

## PURPOSE
This framework defines the structure, purpose, and logic behind the Temporal Matrix Vault experiment.
It allows future sessions (with or without memory) to reinitialize context and testing methodology quickly.

        ├── simulation_data.csv
        └── entries.txt

    ├── drift_annotations.csv
    ├── README_MATRIX.txt
    ├── README_FRAMEWORK_MATRIX_VAULT.txt   # (This file)
